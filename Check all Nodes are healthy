After installing kubernetes, ansible will give us a report that says everything is ok, and all nodes and their components are in good situation.

we can check this by running below commands in Master and Worker nodes to make sure that all of pods that we setup in Kubespray configuration 
are up and running.

        $ kubectl get pods -o wide -A
# here we will see all pods are running nice and smooth.

Note: if you enable dashboard you may see some pods like coredns and dashboard itself are stuck in pending mode!
to fix this just simply disble tain in nodes.

        $ kubectl taint nodes master{1..3} node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized-
        $ kubectl taint nodes worker{1..9} node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized-
if you wonder what will happens in background of above command it will simply remove the "taint" block in below file:

        kubectl edit node <node-name> 

            taints:
              - effect: NoSchedule 
                key: node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized 
                value: "true" 
    # if you want you can just do it by yourself insted of using the command :)
