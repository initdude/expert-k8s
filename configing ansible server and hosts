first build network infrastructure for our ansible server and hosts(Masters,Workers and etcds) in vsphere and in same vlan.
set hosts in /etc/hosts on ansible server. this is for calling hosts by name insted of IPs.
generated ssh key on ansible server and then copy it to all of ansible hosts.
		ssh-keygen -t rsa
		ssh-copy-id "hosts"
		test the connection.
when everything was good we proceed to next step that is configuering kubespray.
