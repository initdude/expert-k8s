first build network infrastructure for our ansible server and hosts(Masters,Workers and etcds) in vsphere and in same vlan.
	IMPORTANT NOTE::: cause in Iran many servers and companies will not give service to Iranian People we should make sure 
	that we have a secure and low latency connection.
		so we must set a proper DNS server in our /etc/netplan/ and /etc/systemd/resolved.conf 

set hosts in /etc/hosts on ansible server. this is for calling hosts by name insted of IPs.
generated ssh key on ansible server and then copy it to all of ansible hosts.
		ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
		ssh-copy-id "hosts"
		test the connection.
when everything was good we proceed to next step that is configuering kubespray.
