cloned kubespray from https://github.com/kubespray/kubespray.git to our ansible server then config the following file with our needs.
first of all run the command pip install requeirments.txt
then copy a sample from /inventory/sample_cluster to /inventory/K8s_cluster to have to all sample of configs.
started with configing folloing files:
        /kubespray/inventory/inventory.ini
        for adding our hosts and with specific ports.
        /kubespray/inventory/k8s_cluster/group_vars/etcd.yml
                        *set etcd_memory_limit: "0"
                                         we must set unriet to 0 for unrestricted RAM.

        /kubespray/inventory/k8s_cluster/all/all.yml
                         set Load Balancer IP and Port
                         set the number of etcds to 5

    /kubespray/inventory/k8s_cluster/group_vars/k8s_cluster/k8s-cluster.yml
                        here we give a name to our cluster
