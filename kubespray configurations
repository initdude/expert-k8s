cloned kubespray from https://github.com/kubespray/kubespray.git to our ansible server then config the following file with our needs.
first of all run the command pip install requeirments.txt
then copy a sample from /inventory/sample_cluster to /inventory/K8s_cluster to have to all sample of configs.
started with configing following files:




   in    /kubespray/inventory/inventory.ini
        for adding our hosts and with specific ports. 




   in   /kubespray/inventory/k8s_cluster/group_vars/etcd.yml
                        *set etcd_memory_limit: "0"
                                         we must set unriet to 0 for unrestricted RAM.





   in  /kubespray/inventory/k8s_cluster/all/all.yml
                         set Load Balancer IP and Port
                         set the number of etcds to 5
                         set cloud_provider: "external"
                         set external_cloud_provider: "vsphere"




   in  /kubespray/inventory/k8s_cluster/group_vars/k8s_cluster/k8s-cluster.yml


                        Kubernetes cluster name, also will be used as DNS domain
                        cluster_name: *****-k8s-cluster.local

                        # Subdomains of DNS domain to be resolved via /etc/resolv.conf for hostnet pods
                        ndots: 4

                        ## Automatically renew K8S control plane certificates on first Monday of each month
                        auto_renew_certificates: true
                        
                        # Set to true to remove the role binding to anonymous users created by kubeadm
                        #remove_anonymous_access: false (we must comment this line)


   in /kubespray/inventory/k8s_cluster/all/vsphere.yaml
                set 
                  ## Values for the external vSphere Cloud Provider

                  external_vsphere_vcenter_ip: "vcenter111.domain.local"

                  external_vsphere_vcenter_port: "443"

                  external_vsphere_insecure: "false"

                  external_vsphere_user: "k8s@nict.local" # Can also be set via the `VSPHERE_USER` environment variable

                  external_vsphere_password: "*********" # Can also be set via the `VSPHERE_PASSWORD` environment variable

                  external_vsphere_datacenter: "************"

                  external_vsphere_kubernetes_cluster_id: "********-1358-4976-89c0-************"

                  ## Vsphere version where located VMs

                  external_vsphere_version: "7u3"





  in  /kubespray/inventory/k8s_cluster/group_vars/k8s_cluster/addons.yml
                  # Helm deployment
                  helm_enabled: true

                  # Metrics Server deployment
                  metrics_server_enabled: true

                  #ephFS provisioner deployment
                  #cephfs_provisioner_enabled: true

                  ingress_nginx_enabled: true  (it must be true for ingress controller)
                  ingress_nginx_host_network: true (it must be true for ingress controller)

                  dashboard_enabled: true (it must be true for having gui dashboard)

                  #argocd_enabled: true    




after congiguring all setup, simply run this command:

ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/inventory.ini --become --become-user=root cluster.yml -b -vv

ansible will starts to install kubernetes with Calico network and all addons that we set before.
follow for more i next session.
